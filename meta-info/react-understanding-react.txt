File Structure and Interactions Explanation:

1. Entry Points:
   - index.tsx: This is the main entry point of your React application. It:
     * Sets up the theme provider
     * Applies global styles
     * Renders the root App component
     * Wraps everything in strict mode for better development experience

2. Core Application Files:
   - App.tsx: The root component of your application that:
     * Provides the basic structure
     * Currently renders the MainLayout and LandingPage components

3. Styling and Theme:
   - styles/theme.ts: Centralizes all styling configuration:
     * Defines a custom Material-UI theme
     * Sets up color palettes
     * Configures typography
     * Defines global styles for consistent appearance

4. Layout Components:
   - components/layout/MainLayout.tsx: Provides the basic structure for all pages:
     * Creates a full-height container
     * Handles basic layout styling
     * Wraps all child components

5. Feature Components:
   - features/landing/components/LandingPage.tsx: A feature-specific component that:
     * Uses styled components for custom styling
     * Implements responsive design
     * Currently displays an "Under Construction" message

6. Routing:
   - routes/index.tsx: Manages application routing:
     * Sets up React Router
     * Defines available routes
     * Wraps routes in the MainLayout

7. API Configuration:
   - services/api/config.ts: Sets up API communication:
     * Configures Axios for HTTP requests
     * Sets base URL and default headers
     * Provides a centralized point for API interactions

8. Package Configuration:
   - package.json: Manages project dependencies and scripts:
     * Lists all npm packages required
     * Defines scripts for development, building, and testing
     * Sets up development tools and configurations

How They Work Together:
1. When the application starts, index.tsx bootstraps the application and applies the theme
2. The theme from theme.ts is used throughout all components for consistent styling
3. App.tsx provides the main structure, using MainLayout as a wrapper
4. Routes are defined in routes/index.tsx, determining what components show at what URLs
5. The LandingPage component is rendered within the MainLayout
6. API calls (when implemented) will use the configured axios instance from api/config.ts

This structure follows React best practices by:
- Separating concerns (styling, layout, features, routing)
- Using a component-based architecture
- Implementing proper file organization
- Setting up centralized theming
- Preparing for API integration

File Reference Guide:

1. /client/src/index.tsx
   Purpose: Application entry point
   Function: Initializes the React application, sets up theme provider, and renders the root component
   Key Features: Theme implementation, global styles application, strict mode configuration

2. /client/src/App.tsx
   Purpose: Root component
   Function: Serves as the main application container
   Key Features: Basic routing setup, main layout implementation

3. /client/src/styles/theme.ts
   Purpose: Theme configuration
   Function: Defines the application's visual foundation
   Key Features: Material-UI theme customization, color palette definition, typography settings, global style rules

4. /client/src/services/api/config.ts
   Purpose: API configuration
   Function: Sets up HTTP client for backend communication
   Key Features: Axios instance configuration, base URL setup, default headers

5. /client/src/routes/index.tsx
   Purpose: Routing configuration
   Function: Manages application navigation
   Key Features: Route definitions, layout wrapping, component mapping

6. /client/src/features/landing/components/LandingPage.tsx
   Purpose: Landing page component
   Function: Displays the initial view users see
   Key Features: Styled components, responsive design, placeholder content

7. /client/src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx
   Purpose: Layout wrapper
   Function: Provides consistent page structure
   Key Features: Flexible container, styling consistency, children component rendering

8. /client/package.json
   Purpose: Project configuration
   Function: Manages dependencies and scripts
   Key Features: NPM package definitions, script commands, development configurations

Each file plays a crucial role in maintaining a well-organized, maintainable, and scalable React application structure. The separation of concerns and modular architecture allows for easy expansion and modification of features as the application grows.
